MULTI-MODAL PNEUMONIA DETECTION
Developed a deep learning system combining chest X-ray and breathing audio to detect pneumonia. Utilized EfficientNetB0 and YAMNet models, with Gradio-based UI for real-time inference. Preprocessing included CLAHE, resizing, and audio embedding. Final diagnosis fused predictions from both modalities, improving accuracy and enabling edge deployment via Raspberry Pi.
